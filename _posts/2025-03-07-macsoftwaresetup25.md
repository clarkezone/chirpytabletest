I regularly perform clean installations on my Mac, PC, and Linux machines. To track how the initial setup process evolves over time, I'm documenting my installation steps. This serves as both a personal reference and a potentially useful guide for others.
## Core Productivity Tools
All of these are pri 0 essential and hence are my first installs.  Apart from Tailscale, these all come from the Mac App Store.

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://tailscale.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Tailscale"><br>[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) | A zero-config VPN for building secure networks, connecting your devices and securing your services without the hassle of traditional VPNs. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Tailscale is the first install for me on all devices as it's how all my devices connect to each other and to private services I self host at home. Although available in the Mac App Store, that version has [various limitations](https://tailscale.com/kb/1065/macos-variants) and hence I do a standalone install.|N|
| 2 | <img src="https://bitwarden.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Bitwarden"><br>[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) | A secure open-source password manager that helps you store, generate, and autofill passwords across all your devices. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** My prefered password manager. I self-host the server and connect to it via the Tailscale tailnet.  Makes logging in to the remaining apps a breaze.|Y|
| 3 | <img src="https://www.craft.do/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Craft"><br>[Craft](https://www.craft.do) | A beautiful and powerful document editor that helps you organize your thoughts, projects, and ideas with rich formatting options. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I am a HUGE fan of Craft going back a number of years.  I find myself using it more and more for an expanding set of tasks including knowledge management, planning, daily task tracking and more. This would be the one app I would take with me to a desert island.|Y|
| 4 | <img src="https://flexibits.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Fantastical"><br>[Fantastical](https://flexibits.com) | A powerful calendar app with natural language processing, allowing you to quickly add events and manage your schedule. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Fantastical is a perfect solution for my needs. Seemless handling of multiple services and calendars e.g. from iCloud and Google calendar, and natural language input for events.  It's on all of my Apple devices as syncs perfectly.  I love the native UI and flexibility around how calendars can be grouped.  Fantastical recently came out for Windows and is on my list to try there. |Y|
| 5 | <img src="https://dayoneapp.com/wp-content/themes/day-one-app/assets/img/day-one-app-logo.svg"  alt="Day One"><br>[Day One](https://dayoneapp.com) | A journaling app that helps you record your life with text, photos, and location data in a beautiful interface. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Prefered diarying solution currently, although since aquisition by WordPress I am starting to think about evaluating new solutions. |Y|

## Core Development GUI Tools
After getting the bare esentials installed, next up it is my primary workload: software development.

| Install Order | Application | Description | Mac App Store |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | <img src="https://zed.dev/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Flogo_icon.d67dc948.webp&w=32&q=100" width="64" alt="Zed"><br>[Zed](https://zed.dev/) | A high-performance, collaborative code editor designed for speed and modern collaboration. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Even though it's early in the development timeline I love Zed because its a modern editor written in Rust using native UI and hence is lightnig fast.  It's being developed by Nathan Sobo and some of the folks who did the [Atom code editor](https://atom-editor.cc) as well as folks like Max Brunsfeld who did [Tree Sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/).  Zed is evolving rapidly and I have no doubt it will continue to gain adoption and popularity. |N|
| 2 | <img src="https://developer.apple.com/assets/elements/icons/xcode-12/xcode-12-96x96_2x.png" width="64" alt="Xcode"><br>[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com) | Apple's integrated development environment for creating apps for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** The more I use XCode the more I like it even though it took a lot of getting used to initially when coming from Visual Studio. |Y|
| 3 | <img src="https://ghostty.org/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Ghostty"><br>[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) | A fast, feature-rich terminal emulator designed for developers with modern UI elements. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** I came across Ghostty as part of a recent quest to learn the Zig programming language.  It was written by [Mitchell Hashimoto](https://mitchellh.com/) of Hashicorp fame and it [lives up to the promise of being fast and feature rich](https://ghostty.org/docs/about). Certainly significantly better Mac option than Alacritty in my experience. |N|
| 4 | <img src="https://ghostty.org/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Ghost remote"><br>Ghost remote | Terminal connection utility using the command: `infocmp -x \| ssh YOUR-SERVER -- tic -x -` **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Needed to support Linux servers correctly. |N|
| 5 | <img src="https://wakatime.com/apple-touch-icon.png" width="64" alt="Wakatime"><br>[Wakatime for Mac](https://wakatime.com) | An automatic time tracking tool that measures your programming activity across different editors and projects. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** Wakatime integrates with all of my code editors including NeoVim to give me stats on how long I spend working on different projects. |N|
| 6 | <img src="https://lmstudio.ai/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="LM Studio"><br>[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) | A desktop app for running and experimenting with large language models locally on your device. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** LM Studio is a tool for running open source AI models locally which is a good way of experimenting with the rapidly evolving space.  Many similar solutions are poping up in different places [like VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEXCCuaV2gc&t=1s).  I like LM Studio because it uses [Apple's MLX framework](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai/mlx-engine) to leverage the full hardware acceleration of Apple Silicon, also rapid developement. |N|
| 7 | <img src="https://code.visualstudio.com/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="VSCode"><br>[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) | Microsoft's powerful code editor with support for debugging, syntax highlighting, and thousands of extensions. **CLARKEZONE TAKE:** VS Code is required for any modern dev environment.  I'm not a fan of [electron-based](https://www.electronjs.org) software in general but have to make an exception here. VS Code is a solid choice with broad support for every language and environment. |N|

## Core Development CLI Tools

It also solves a major pain point with using multiple dev-boxes by enabling syncing either via an encrypted cloud service or a selfhostable version. |n|
| 2 | <img src="https://brew.sh/assets/img/homebrew-256x256.png" width="64" alt="Homebrew"><br>[brew](https://brew.sh) | The missing package manager for macOS, allowing easy installation of software and tools. **Clarkezone Take:** Brew is mandatory for development on MacOS. |n|

| 8 | podman completions | Command-line completions for Podman commands. |n|
| 9 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/master/logo/logo.png" width="64" alt="Kubernetes"><br>[kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) | Command-line tool for running commands against Kubernetes clusters. **Clarkezone Take:** Since my home infra uses self-hosted Kubernetes clusters I need this. |n|
| 10 | kubectl completions | Command-line completions for Kubernetes commands. |n|
| 11 | Kubeconfig for cluster4 | Configuration file for accessing the Kubernetes cluster4. |n|
| 12 | NAS | Access configuration for NASMKii storage system. |n|

It is syntax compatible with Python but offers static typing, compilation to native binaries, memory safety and supports not only CPU but also targets such as GPU, NPU. It is interesting to me because it eliminates the need for models to have a mix of Python (for ease of development and iteration), C++ (for deploying performance-critical kernels) and CUDA for targeting GPUs. |n|

Simpler than Rust, compiler can be used as a drop-in replacement for C/C++ compilers, comptime is an interesting take on metaprogramming. |n|
