I use Mac's, PC's and Linux machines and from time to time i "repave" with a clean OS and clean app installs.  It can be interesting to track how the "initial install" changes for an any given OS over time, hence I decided to document this for next time both as a record for myself as well as to share it with you in case there is anything interesting.

| 1 | [Mojo Lang](https://www.modular.com/mojo) | <img src="https://www.modular.com/static/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="Mojo Lang"> | Modern programming language for AI development with Python compatibility. | Mojo is a super interesting emerging language conceived by [[Chris Lattner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner)]() and based on [[LLVM](https://llvm.org)]() and [MLIR]([https://mlir.llvm.org](https://mlir.llvm.org)). It is syntax compatible with Python but offers static typing, compilation to native binaries, memory safety and supports not only CPU but also targets such as GPU, NPU. It is interesting to me because it eliminates the need for models to have a mix of Python (for ease of development and iteration), C++ (for deploying performance-critical kernels) and CUDA for targeting GPUs. |y|
| 2 | Mojo completions | | Command-line completions for Magic Mojo commands. | | |
| 3 | [NeoVim](https://neovim.io) | <img src="https://neovim.io/favicon.ico" width="64" alt="NeoVim"> | Hyperextensible Vim-based text editor focused on extensibility and usability. | VIM is the best terminal based editor (clearly :-)) and Neovim is the modern evolving offshoot of this classic with great extensibility via [lua]([https://www.lua.org](https://www.lua.org)). My config uses [Lazy](https://lazy.folke.io) and can be found [here.](https://github.com/clarkezone/neovimconfig/tree/lazyport) I love [the Primagen's hilarious YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@thevimeagen?si=vjynJNCEYKynPSUs) about the merits of VIM. |y|

Simpler than Rust, compiler can be used as a drop-in replacement for C/C++ compilers, comptime is an interesting take on metaprogramming. |y|
| 11 | [Cline](https://github.com/clarkezone/cline) | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clarkezone/cline/main/assets/cline.png" width="64" alt="Cline"> | A command-line interface tool for enhancing developer productivity. | Cline takes agentic AI to the next level and has been a game changer for me. It uses openrouter to abstract different LLM backend services and associated token purchasing, supports Anthropic's [Model Contaxt Protocol]([https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol)) to reach into and reason over different tools and environments.
